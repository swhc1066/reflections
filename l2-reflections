What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Git initializes that directory with a file called .git.  This allows you to run git in this project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is the area where files are set to commit their changes.  The working directory is the directory where all files live regardless of their status.  It offers a snapshot of what files have been changed and need to be commited
