How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
	If you iterated on code and discovered an older version was the best way to solve a problem
	You can look at old code and see how youve improved

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
	Pros - you have complete control
	you have control over what to name them
	you choose when to commit

	Cons - if you forget to commit
	youre commits are too big

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	knowing your commitng to a certain function or feature in a project you would want to see all the changes related to that feature and the files they affected
	goggle docs was made for single document version control for say word docs excel etc.  most of those arent linked to each other

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
	Git log lets you see a list opf all the commits in that projexct.  and git diff lets you compare 2 different commits to see what was added and deleted and changed

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
	because you can alwys go back and find what changed that broke things and then eidt those changes back to how things worked
